I did what those thugs couldn't do in twenty years. After a few years of flames and Hollywood-style fire, don't ask me how, but I found myself in command of the entire drug empire here in Knox County. Plus, I also cured myself of cancer, maybe it was my pills?

Listen to me until the end because this way you'll be able to get by and get some useful items! If you haven't already, enter the Kingdom of Pyno (Discord), just press Y to see the link. From there you can see all the maps and useful tips, as well as get to know other survivors who might help you in the future. If you want to see some spoilers about what might happen and what happens in here you can also follow me on Twitch and comment live (pynoTTV). Know that on Discord weekly or monthly Events are created, don't miss them! We'll always get along until you disrespect anyone within the server. I hope you'll always manage to stay on the right side, acting according to rules and not giving in to the provocations of toxic players that we'll always try to keep away. I assume you won't use any strange tricks to make things easier inside the game and you'll report if someone does, the idea would be to have a fair challenge. Anyway, never bring any discussion that arises in the game into the general Discord chats. If you have any kind of problem, you're obliged to open a ticket on Discord or in the game. If you want to become a sort of Outlaw, I expect, more than from the other players who will have to do it to detect bugs or malfunctions, that you'll record your game with software, also remember that the Admins won't refund anything on trust. After months of preparation, finally, together with the legendary Ioshi (and also with the help of good-hearted people without ulterior motives who believed in the project from the beginning without ever giving up), we managed to recreate a world with more than 40 NPCs, for a total of over 500 different missions. I'm sure you'll have fun if you face it all with the right spirit. The server is generally PVE but you might still encounter unpleasant things if you wander into PVP zones, and I assure you, if you really want to expand or have a large group, you'll practically be forced to do so. I hope you'll always take it as a challenge and with philosophy, remembering that we're inside a game. If you feel like contributing to growing this community you can always buy some Tuna from Ioshi, on Discord you'll understand how to do it, we'd be very grateful.

IGUI_SFQuest_Questyno_Pyno2_Begin_Text = "The NPCs will guide you step by step in the early stages of survival, you're not obligated to deal with them but they could give you a hand to start and they are necessary, for example, if you want to stop coming back to refill your Small Gas Can every in-game month (4 real days) here at the Den. An NPC will give you your first crowbar, another your first generator, another your first car, etc. Thanks to the missions you'll obtain Reputation useful for unlocking other NPCs, other items obtainable from the NPCs, and so on, but above all to claim your first Safehouse. Thanks to another Mod, created by the legendary Lele, the game has become completely RPG. If you've tried the single-player experience, forget everything. Here you can level up your skills to level 4, if you want to surpass this limit you'll need a character with other skills or you'll have to take special drugs in-game. Know that the loot respawns with a 1/10 probability in every container, every real-time week, if no player has passed through that area in the last 24 in-game hours (3 real hours). The zombies are a very low number but respawn very quickly. So yes, loot might seem scarce to you, especially if you've just started playing, but you should be able to clear out an entire town in an afternoon with a friend, only to find it full of zombies again within a few days. Also, it's important to accumulate money more than loot and you can do it simply thanks to the ''Rewards'' and in general by killing zombies. You'll be given rewards for every Tot Kill (mostly money) and every Tot Days of survival (mostly Special Items), if you want on Discord you'll find more precise indications regarding the skills and rewards. Among these special rewards in the first days you'll also receive these special ''Drugs''. They'll be useful to give you some skill points on your character. We don't like the ''Skill Recovery Book'' that lets you recover skills after death, but with these Drugs, by continuing to play you'll be able to reach the skills you had before dying even faster. In addition, you'll also be able to craft them yourself or get missions from NPCs, to recover them around the map. By pressing ESC you can still see a special Diary purchasable through the Server Point Shop, you'll accumulate 1 every hour of gameplay, so our ''Special Diary'' is a gem reserved for those who reach about 2000 hours of Gameplay on the server, in short, we want to give it only to those who have really been playing for a long time and not to anyone indiscriminately.",

The server is therefore suitable for a novice (who doesn't want to compare himself to a veteran or skip steps or play on a multiplayer server as if it were a single-player game) but also for a more experienced player looking for a greater challenge. Anyway, at any level you are, I recommend you learn to deal with the Runners. The runners are more fragile than other zombies and are present for 20% during the day and 5% during the night. You can know when it's nighttime thanks to the Full Moon at the top right of the screen (23:00/5:00). Even if you'll see poorly, I recommend you buy a torch at the Resistance Market and go around during the nighttime, it'll be safer! Also remember that infection only occurs through Saliva, so don't worry if you get Scratched or Lacerated but worry only about Bites, without a cure you're done for. At least at launch, the rarest item in the server is gasoline (players can really influence the market and gameplay of other players based on how they act over the months). You'll be able to get it once a month (4 real days) only by buying it from various NPCs. Initially, you'll be able to refill only one Small Can here at the Den Gas Station. This small stock will be useful only to keep a freezer active and have some small supplies for short trips by car, anyway if you've been following me on Twitch for a while, you'll have noticed that for a person who plays a couple of hours a day, larger stocks aren't needed. Later, when you reach the ''Resistance Member'' rank, you'll be able to ask for a Medium Can every month at every Gas Station located in the PVP zones, there will always be one of Nigel's henchmen waiting for you, in this way your gasoline stocks will multiply from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 32 times. Finally, by reaching the Veteran rank, in addition to being able to do the quest to learn how to produce the Cure, you'll also be able to refill a Large Can autonomously at the gas stations in the PVP zones to accumulate gasoline and maybe resell it. Reaching a higher rank will also help you to get Safehouses (zones not trespassable by other players) larger and in better areas, (the Toxic PVP Zone is better than the PVP Zone which is better than the PVE zone which is better than the Neutral zones which are better than lasagna) as well as give you the chance to build a personal Market to sell your goods to other Players, next to your home or the Den.

These will make the weather good and bad inside the server, but I don't want to spoil anything for you. The NPCs are divided into 4 categories. Those from the Den will give you Daily missions (every 3 real hours) others will give you Weekly missions (every 21 real hours) others still Monthly missions (every 4 real days) other more important ones once a year (every 48 real days). Finally, some will be ''Chains'' these missions can be done only once, among these you'll get rewards like: a first weapon, a first wheelbarrow, a first generator with magazine, a first vehicle, a first Medium Can etc etc, up to the supreme Item, the one needed to create the Cure. You can try to get monthly books to produce a Vaccine but for the Cure you'll have only one chance. The server is designed to increase the challenge as you move away from the Den, you'll generally find more and more zombies/loot as you move away from this position. This place can be a good spot to farm money and fame, as there are simple daily missions, even if you're not yet very experienced in the game. The idea is to make you move away spontaneously as you start to become experts and you no longer need to do these missions but prefer to do fewer but more challenging and rewarding ones. The Resistance on this server aims to reveal the truth behind the origin of the epidemic, investigating the connection between Nigel and the Americans and these latter with the Resistance itself. The goal is to create an effective cure to reduce losses and reform a new civilization... Now take this wallet and this Credit Card, I'll explain two things to you.",

By right-clicking on the Credit Card you can also send money to another player. If you lose the card you can always link a new one and your balance won't be lost. Now try to open the wallet I gave you, you can find from 2 to 6 dollars inside the wallets. You'll find several on zombies but you can also get them as rewards for kills or survival days. Always remember to check in the corpses if there's someone! You can use the Money you accumulate at the Resistance Market and you'll also be able to withdraw it always in that place. I suggest you use the money I gave you to buy a Pot thanks to which you'll be able to sterilize rags in the campfire or accumulate a little water from the well to move away more easily from this area! You could also think about a torch or a lighter, see for yourself! Have fun and if you have any problems, open a ticket. Good luck, use this pen to mark the position of the Den on the map! [M]",
